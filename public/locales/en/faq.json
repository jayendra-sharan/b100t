    "question": "1. What is this app all about?",
    "answer": "<p>This app is a goal-setting social network designed to help individuals set, track, and celebrate their personal goals ‚Äî while staying motivated through community-driven accountability. It's a distraction-free, no-nonsense platform focused entirely on progress and purpose.</p>"
  },
  {
    "question_id": "q02",
    "question": "2. How is it different from productivity or habit-tracking apps?",
    "answer": "<p>Most productivity apps are either private tools (like to-do lists or calendars) or general-purpose social apps with noisy feeds. This platform combines the best of both worlds ‚Äî structured personal goal tracking with social accountability and inspiration ‚Äî minus the clutter of comments, endless likes, or random content.</p>"
  },
  {
    "question_id": "q03",
    "question": "3. Who is this app for?",
    "answer": "<p><ul><li>Individuals who are serious about setting and completing personal goals.</li><li>People looking to be inspired by others' achievements.</li><li>Those who want to track their progress with or without sharing publicly.</li><li>Friends or partners working on shared life goals together.</li></ul></p>"

    "question": "4. How do I get started?",
    "answer": "<p><ol><li>Sign up using your email.</li><li>Fill out a basic profile (name, bio, visibility settings).</li><li>Start adding your goals ‚Äî up to 100 predefined or custom goals.</li><li>As you complete goals, post progress updates to your timeline.</li></ol></p>"
  },
  {
    "question_id": "q05",
    "question": "5. What kind of goals can I add?",
    "answer": "<p>You can:</p><ul><li>Choose from predefined goal templates (e.g., run a marathon, visit 10 countries).</li><li>Create custom goals tailored to your personal ambitions.</li><li>Categorize your goals (travel, fitness, learning, finance, etc.).</li><li>Track your progress as a count ‚Äî for example, 10/100 goals completed.</li></ul>"
  },
  {
    "question_id": "q06",
    "question": "6. What is the timeline/feed?",
    "answer": "<p>The timeline is a stream of updates from the community, showing goal completions and milestones from all users (unless filtered). It's similar to a social feed ‚Äî but only for meaningful progress updates, no distractions.</p><p>You can:</p><ul><li>View posts from the entire network.</li><li>Toggle to see only posts from your friends or partner.</li><li>React to achievements (e.g., üëå, üî•, üéâ), but not leave open-ended comments.</li></ul>"
  },
  {
    "question_id": "q07",
    "question": "7. Can I post anonymously?",
    "answer": "<p>Yes. When posting an update, you can choose to:</p><ul><li>Post publicly with your name.</li><li>Post anonymously, so others only see ‚ÄúA user just completed a goal.‚Äù</li></ul><p>This applies to all post types, except when uploading an image (image posts must be public).</p>"
  },
  {
    "question_id": "q08",
    "question": "8. Can I upload pictures with my goal updates?",
    "answer": "<p>Yes, but with a privacy safeguard:</p><ul><li>You can only upload images on public posts.</li></ul><p>This is because posting an image while staying anonymous doesn't serve the purpose ‚Äî images may reveal your identity or context. In the future, we plan to add a feature that allows users to maintain a private album of completed goals and achievements for personal reflection and record-keeping.</p>"
  },
  {
    "question_id": "q09",
    "question": "9. Can I comment on posts?",
    "answer": "<p>No, and that's intentional. To stay focused and free from distractions, we've removed open-text comments. Instead, users can:</p><ul><li>React using pre-selected emojis.</li><li>Add short, predefined motivational phrases (like ‚ÄúGreat job!‚Äù or ‚ÄúKeep it up!‚Äù).</li></ul>"
  },
  {
    "question_id": "q10",
    "question": "10. How do social connections work?",
    "answer": "<p>You can build a small social circle within the platform:</p><ul><li>Follow other users.</li><li>Send friend requests.</li><li>Tag a partner (e.g., for shared goals like traveling together or getting fit).</li><li>Your connections help you stay motivated ‚Äî and they'll be notified when you achieve goals.</li></ul>"
  },
  {
    "question_id": "q11",
    "question": "11. How is privacy handled on the platform?",
    "answer": "<p>Privacy is one of our core principles.</p><p>You can:</p><ul><li>Choose to keep your profile public, private, or visible to friends only.</li><li>Post anonymously if you don't want to share your identity.</li><li>Control who can see your posts, goal progress, and tagged updates.</li><li>Choose whether or not your friends or partner can tag you in public or private updates.</li></ul>"

    "question_id": "q12",
    "question": "12. What happens when I complete a goal?",
    "answer": "<p>When you complete a goal:</p><ul><li>You're prompted to share it on the feed (optional).</li><li>You can attach an image (only in public mode).</li><li>The update will show your progress count (e.g., ‚ÄúA user has completed 10 out of 70 goals.‚Äù).</li><li>Friends and other users can react with encouragement.</li></ul>"
  },
  {
    "question_id": "q13",
    "question": "13. Are there any distractions like ads or feeds unrelated to goals?",
    "answer": "<p>No. This app is intentionally designed to be:</p><ul><li>Ad-free</li><li>Comment-free</li><li>Focused purely on personal growth and progress</li></ul><p>You won't find memes, politics, or unrelated content here ‚Äî just real stories of people achieving meaningful goals.</p>"
